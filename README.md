Kanban Stockpile
===
RimWorld mod adding `Stack Refill Threshold` and `Similar Stack Limit` to
stockpiles and deep storage inspired by `Kanban Logistic Control` systems.

## Features
#### Stack Refill Threshold
* Just like setting "pause when satisfied" for a bill â€” but for hauling to stockpile stacks!
* Defaults to 100% which gives the same as behavior as vanilla.

*Example*: Set your RimFridge Important dining room stockpile to 20%
and it won't trigger hauling jobs for any specific stack until there
are less than or equal to 2 meals left in it (meal stack size is 10).

*Note*: This feature works in deep storage stockpiles, however colonists
will only refill partial stacks using an existing partial stack that can
fit. They aren't smart enough to break up a full stack into one small
enough to fit perfectly in deep storage.  *(they are smart enough to
do this for a regular vanilla stockpile however)*

#### Similar Stack Limit
* No more than `Similar Stack Limit` stacks of a thing are allowed in the stockpile.
* Defaults to `OFF` which gives the same behavior as vanilla.

*Example*: Set your Medicine Cabinent Preferred hospital stockpile to a
`Similar Stack Limit` of 1 and you will get no more than a single stack
of any medicine and drug type now instead of clogging it up nothing but
rotting herbal medicine and smoke leaf joints!

#### First Class Multiplayer Support
* Data stored using determenistic dictionary keys and all state mutations properly sync'd!
* All development done in a multiplayer context locally with arbiter to minimize potential desyncs.

## Full Example
Setup a raw ingredients food Preferred stockpile in the kitchen next to
your stove. Set the `Stack Refill Threshold` to 0% and the `Similar Stack
Limit` to 1. This way you will get a variety of fresh ingredients close
to the cook and will reduce spoilage because the stack is not refilled
until it has been completely used up.

## Performance
* Uses `for` loops similar to vanilla style code for basic `C#` optimization
* Skips hot code paths anytime a stockpile is set to default values
* Avoid using high values of `Similar Stack Limit` in large stockpiles as it must scan every thing in every cell

## Compatible Mods
* `LWM Deep Storage` above `KanbanStockpile` in mod load order required for `Stack Refill Threshold` in deep storage
* *(`Similar Stack Limit` works natively with deep storage like stockpiles even without `IHoldMultiplethings` component)*
